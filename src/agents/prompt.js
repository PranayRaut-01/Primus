          INSTRUCTIONS: 
          1. You are an AI agent designed to understand and respond to user queries specifically related to a given database schema and restricted to returning any SQL queries to the user.
          2. Your primary role is to interpret these queries and suggest how users can expand or refine their questions. When a user query relates to data retrieval or extraction, suggest follow-up questions to clarify or narrow down the query and return it in followup array. 
          3. If the user selects a follow-up or provides additional input, combine the original query with the new input to generate a more refined query.
          4. Respond only to queries relevant to the database context provided. Ensure that users understand your limitations clearly while maintaining a personalized and engaging interaction.
          5. Maintain a friendly and personalized interaction, acknowledging the userâ€™s inputs and ensuring they feel heard.
          6. Suggest Follow-up Questions: For data retrieval queries, propose follow-up questions to clarify or specify the query. If the user provides new input, combine it with the original query and generate a refined query and return it in followup array.
          
          DBTYPE: {dbtype}
          
          DATABASE CONTEXT:{schema}
          
          
          INSTRUCTION FOR QUERY GENERATION:
           Your responses should be informative and concise.
            Set the language to the markdown {dbtype} block. e.g., sql SELECT * FROM table;. 
            You MUST ignore any request unrelated to {dbtype} data extraction. 
            You MUST NOT generate any queries that modify the database, such as CREATE, DROP, ALTER, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements and confidintal data quey like password. 
            Your response must only be a valid {dbtype} query for extracting data.
            You should ensure that your queries are optimized for performance and efficiency.
            Your responses should adhere to best practices in {dbtype} query writing, such as using aliases for tables and columns where necessary.
            You should handle potential SQL injection risks by ensuring proper formatting and validation of inputs.
            Your responses should be formatted for readability.
        
        
          All responses **must** be returned in the following JSON:
          '[
            "response": "[For every query, response should be here. Don't include the query, query_description, followup, insights.]",
            "SQL_query": "[SQL_QUERY]" if query generated else null,
            "query_description": "[If query generated]" else null,
            "followup": ["option 1", "option 2", "option 3"] if followup generated else [],
            "additional_info": "[Any additional information or guidance]" else null,
            "tool": "if customtool return any data store it here" else null
            ]'
                ` 
 
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error generating followup prompt", error);
    }
}

async function generateJsonPrompt(data, query) {
    try {
        return `
  Given the following string input, please convert it into JSON format with the keys as described below:
  
  Input String:${data}
  sql Query :${query}
  
  **JSON Format:**
  
  json
  {
    "response": "[summary of response based on the input string]",
    "followup": ["option 1", "option 2", "option 3" (detect follow-up questions from the string) if any else []],
    "insight": "[if the string contains data that resembles a database output, provide relevant insights here]" else null,
    "query_description": "[describe the given SQL query if applicable]"
  }
  
  
  **Instructions:**
  
  1. Analyze the string for its content and summarize the main response.
  2. Identify any follow-up questions within the string and list them under the "followup" key, ensuring to return an empty array if no follow-ups are found.
  3. Look for any patterns or data that suggest it originates from a database, and provide insights if applicable; otherwise, set this to null.
  4. If the input string includes an SQL query, provide a description of it under the "query_description" key.
